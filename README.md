**Salmonberry Addition** is an addon for modifications such as __Regions Unexplored__ and __Farmer's Delight__. He adds mainly juices and pastries made from salmon berries.

I do this modification alone in my free time. The mod was made purely for myself (this is my first mod), I am not against others using it in their builds. Just keep in mind that this addon will only work with the mods described above!
